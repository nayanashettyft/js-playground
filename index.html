		<h1>Bharatnatyam, a classical dance form from south India</h1>
		<h2>Welcome!!</h2>
		<img src="images/natraja.jpg" alt="natraja">
		<p> The word Bharatnatyam is formed of 4 sanskrit words, Bha-ra-ta-natyam, </p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Bha stands for Bhava</li>
			<li>Ra stands for Raga</li>
			<li>Ta stands for tala</li>
			<li>Natyam</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong>Bhava</strong> meaning emotions, <strong>Raga</strong> meaning music, <strong>Tala</strong> meaning rhythm and <strong>Natya</strong> meaning dance. In this dance form, dancers express a scene with a combination of facial expressions(nritya) and pure dance(nritta).<br/>
			Conventionally this is a solo dance performed only by women in the Hindu temples in south India however these days there are a lot of different variants of this dance performed all over the world.
